## 📜 What is Prosperity?

Prosperity is a 15-day long trading competition where players earn "seashells" to grow their "archipelago" in 5 rounds (each 3 days long). Each round new products are introduced that each have their own unique properties resembling real world tradable assets; you can always trade products from previous rounds so it's a game of finding alpha and optimizing previous strategies. To trade these products we wrote and submitted python files that performed systematic trades but every round also had a manual trading aspect to it. The manual trading challenges were typically centered around game theory decisions and had us playing around other participants' choices. 

At the end of each round, the algorithmic trading scripts and manual trading challenges were evaluated and added to our islands' PNL.

## 🗂 Repo Structure
Our code is split into the rounds that they were built for, all of the EDA, research, manual, and trader code is located within them.

Good luck parsing it, things got a little scrappy near the end...
